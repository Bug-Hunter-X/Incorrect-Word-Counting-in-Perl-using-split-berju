This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an error in word counting using the split function. The script attempts to count words in a string but incorrectly handles multiple spaces between words.  A solution is provided in a separate file which uses a more robust approach. This example is useful to illustrate how seemingly minor oversights can affect the logic of even simple algorithms.  Always carefully consider edge cases and potential variations in your input data when developing programs.
